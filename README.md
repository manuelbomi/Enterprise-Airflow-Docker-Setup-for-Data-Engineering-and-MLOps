# Enterprise Airflow Docker Setup for Data Engineering & MLOps

This repository provides a robust, production-grade Apache Airflow environment using Docker Compose, designed for building and running complex data engineering pipelines, CI and MLOps workflows. 


#### The repository is complete with templates and examples for:

üê≥ Dockerized Apache Airflow with LocalExecutor

- Enterprise orchestration

- MLOps workflow

- Data Engineering ETL

‚úÖ CI/CD with GitHub Actions for validation and testing :

- DAG syntax validation

- Unit tests with pytest

- Function argument passing (op_kwargs)

- DAG templates for: BashOperator & PythonOperator

üîÅ Retry logic and task dependencies

-  Visual monitoring through Airflow Web UI
  
- Plug-and-play template structure for fast development

- DAG status visualization via the Airflow UI

üß∞ Production-ready and extensible
